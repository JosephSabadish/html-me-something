<p class= "intro">Hi. My name is <strong>Joseph Sabadish</strong>. I am from
St. Petersburg, FL. I am taking this class to both
improve my programming skills and gain 
skills I can use in the workplace. Both will
most likely prove to be beneficial. This applies
to not only short-term, but to any long-term situations
also.</p>


<p class= "introtwo">I have knowledge of programming skills prior to 
starting the Launchcode 101 course. Throughout my
education, I have learned and had experience with the
SQL, Java and C# programming languages. I have had
experience working with SQL in high school courses and
also in courses at USF St Petersburg. C# and Java I learned
and had experience with at the college-level.</p>

<p class= "introtwo">Besides what I have already, I also hope to learn any
additional languages taught by the course. Any additional languages
will more than likely help in making me appear more marketable. Also,
any workforce related skills I learn/hear about in LC101,(via guest
speakers, online readings) can help strengthen my repetoire and also
aid in helping me fit in to the workplace. </p>   
   
   <p>I plan to keep expanding my skill set, even when this class ends. </p>
